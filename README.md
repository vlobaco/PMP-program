The goal of this project is to generate a burn down chart that helps me to tally my progress toward my PMP Certification.

For this, I will extract out of the images containing the content for the [PMP Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-certification-exam-prep-course-pmbok-6th-edition) two lists:
- **Sections**. Each section must contain the title, the number of lessons, and total time.
- **Lessons**. Each lesson must contain the section to which it belongs, the name and its length.

The total number of lessons and time must be check with that reported with the lesson.
